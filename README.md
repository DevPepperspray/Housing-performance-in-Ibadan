# Housing-performance-in-Ibadan
Analyzed how Nigeria's monetary policy affects housing performance in Ibadan using SPSS. Found that CRR drives 2-bedroom prices, while MPR drives 3-bedroom prices—revealing a segmented market response.

Just delivered a deep-dive SPSS analysis for a real estate research project.

I was brought on as the data analyst to examine how monetary policy instruments impact housing performance in Ibadan, Nigeria (2010–2025). Using SPSS, I transformed raw economic and housing data into actionable insights.

What I Delivered:

- Cleaned, validated, and structured 15 years of macroeconomic and property performance data

- Conducted regression analysis to measure effects of Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), Money Supply (M2), Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), and Liquidity Ratio

- Identified key drivers of housing performance across 2-bedroom vs. 3-bedroom property types

- Addressed multicollinearity and model diagnostics to ensure robust findings

- Visualized trends and relationships through charts and summary dashboards

Key Takeaway from the Analysis:

Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) was the strongest predictor for 2-bedroom properties, while MPR drove 3-bedroom performance—revealing a segmented market response to monetary policy.
This project reinforced my ability to turn complex data into clear, strategic insights for real estate and policy stakeholders. Open to connecting with professionals in real estate analytics, economic research, or data-driven consulting!
